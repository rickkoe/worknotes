## Implementation
### Data Collector Requirements
You can install the data collector on the following operating systems:  

- Windows Server 2012 and later.  
- POWER6® or later systems that use AIX® 7.x or later. The AIX data collector can run on a physical AIX installation or a logical partition (LPAR).  
- The Linux® data collector runs on 64-bit Linux operating systems on x86-64 and PPC64LE systems only.  
    - The supported Linux operating systems for x86-64 are Red Hat® Enterprise Linux 7 or later and CentOS 7 and later versions.  
    - The supported Linux operating system for PPC64LE is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x on POWER8® and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.x. on POWER9™® and POWER10®. The data collector on Linux PPC64LE has the additional limitation that you cannot monitor IBM FlashSystem A9000, XIV®, IBM Storage Accelerate, and non-IBM devices.
